# Update 12/11/2021

Hello! It's been a while since this was updated, and it's likely it never will be, however, I want to keep this because I made a programming language all this time ago!
I think this is just really cool ig. Don't think this represents my current ability.

# Mang

Mang is a NEW Coding language.
It's built to be really easy, and the `main.py` file is ONLY ~150 lines!
Python is the coding language it uses to run, to use it just run the file in a python shell
There is no official documentation for mang, but there is demo files on the github

## Running `mang` scripts

In order to run mang scripts you first have to start mang.

On repl.it: https://mlang.eldonwilliams.repl.run/

Using local python:
```bash
python main.py
```

Output
